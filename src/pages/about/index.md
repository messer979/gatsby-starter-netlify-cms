### Prestigious Religious Nannies
We believe in two things when it comes to childcare: decorum and prayer. All of our children receive the most formal of care one can imagine. Furthermore, we implement a child-first schedule for reading Bible Children stories, learning simple prayers before meals, before naps, and at each Nappy change. Your child will be steeped in prayer during his or her time under our care.
